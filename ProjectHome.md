This is a Javascript port of the classic 1970s Super Star Trek game, one of a number of (mostly) related trek-themed games from that era. Step into the flared trousers of James T Kirk and command the Enterprise across a galaxy of 8x8 quadrants to repel an invasion of evil Klingon battlecruisers.

This version is specifically a direct port of Chris Nystrom's C port (v1.1) of the BASIC version from David Ahl's "BASIC Computer Games" of 1978. It's probably the most famous version of all, and the Javascript version is lovingly faithful, making no gameplay changes at all (apart from a few options).

There's more history than that actually, but I think that's enough for now. See project web page if you want archeological-level detail.
